Settings used for automatically extending NWN-reduced (which resulted in attachment over 40% and accuracy over 80% when evaluating 
on the test set):

k = 6
Smin = 0.55
Words that did not have hypernyms in NWN-reduced were further excluded from the set of k similar words.
d = 0.05
Frequency cut-off on target words: 1000
Cut-off on hypernym score: 3.4

2846 words from the Norwegian news corpus, which do not occur in NWN-reduced, occurs more than or equal to 1000 times,
and do not include proper nouns. 996 words are assigned a hypernym when scoring hypernyms with the given settings,
but only 158 have a hypernym with a score of 3.4 or more. Training word embeddings og the full corpus, would probably have 
given higher numbers.

Examples of words that are added:

n√¶ringsminister {politiker}
oppussing {bygning}
pengebruk {investering}
infeksjon {syke; sykdom; lidelse; sjuke; sjukdom}
spanjol {statsborger}
