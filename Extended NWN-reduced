Settings used for automatically extending NWN-reduced (which resulted in attachment over 40% and accuracy over 80% when evaluating 
on the test set):

k = 6
Smin = 0.55
Words that did not have hypernyms in NWN-reduced were further excluded from the set of k similar words.
d = 0.05
Frequency cut-off on target words: 1000
Cut-off on hypernym score: 3.4

2846 words from the Norwegian news corpus, which do not occur in NWN-reduced, occurs more than or equal to 1000 times,
and do not include proper nouns. 996 words are assigned a hypernym when scoring hypernyms with the given settings,
but only 158 have a hypernym with a score of 3.4 or more. A frequency cut-off of this size limits the numbers quite a lot, 
training word embeddings og the full corpus, would probably have given higher numbers. Just considering a certain cut-off
on the hypernym score is maybe better in this case. 

Examples of words that are added:

n√¶ringsminister 'industry minister' {politiker 'politician'}
oppussing 'renovation' {bygning 'building'}
pengebruk 'mony spending' {investering 'investment'}
infeksjon 'infection' {syke 'illness'; sykdom 'sickness'; lidelse 'disorder'; sjuke 'illness'; sjukdom 'sickness'}
spanjol 'Spaniard' {statsborger 'citizen'}

An amount of the words get the rather top concept {person; head; human; individual} as their hypernym,
even in cases this does not seem to fit that well. A distributional similarity between hyponym
and the words in the hypernym would thus be valuable.
